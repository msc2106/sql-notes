    "```\n",
    "\n",

    "In some dialects, including SQLite and PostgreSQL, strings are concatenated with `||`, while in others like MySQL, this is done with the `CONCAT()` function:\n",
    "```sql\n",
    "'this' || ' and that'\n",
    "CONCAT('this', ' and that')\n",
    "```\n",
    "Note that `||` can be strung together consecutively, and `CONCAT()` can take any number of parameters. Non-strings will be converted automatically.\n",
    "\n",
    "Other string functions include:\n",
    "- The case of a string can be manipulated with `UPPER(str)`, `LOWER(str)`, and `INITCAP(str)` (i.e. title case).\n",

    "- `CHAR_LENGTH(str)` or `LENGTH(str)`\n",
    "- `REPLACE(stringval, 'pattern to match', 'replacement')`.\n",
    "- `POSITION('pat' IN strval)` or `STRPOS(strval, 'pat')`: returns the first 1-indexed starting position of a pattern, or 0 if not found.\n",
    "- `LEFT(strval, n)` `RIGHT(strval, n)`: returns the first or last `n` characters of a string.\n",
    "- `SUBSTR[ING](strval, start, length)` or `SUBSTRING(strval FROM start FOR length)`. Note that lengths that extend beyond end of string will be ignored, so a lenght of `LENGTH(strval)` will always ensure getting the rest of the string. These functions will accept starting positions less than 1 but will eat up length until a valid index is reached. That is to say `SUBSTR('anything', 0, 1)` is always an empty string.\n",
    "- `TRIM()`: removes characters from ends of string. Given just a string value, it will remove whitespace from beginning and end. `LTRIM` and `RTRIM` can only trim from one side each.\n",
    "- Padding: `LPAD` and `RPAD`. Both take three parameters: the string value, the desired length, and the string to append as padding (defaulting to `' '`). Note that this function truncates strings longer than the indicated length and will truncate the padding string if it does not fit evenly into the needed padding.\n",
    "- `SPLIT_PART(strval, delimiter, part])`; negative values of `part` count from end.\n",

    "The `=` operator performs a character-for-character comparison. It is also possible to pattern match with the `LIKE` or `ILIKE` operators. In pattern strings, `%` represents a free wildcard, so `LIKE 'a%'` will match `'a'`, `'aa'`, `'aba'`, etc. The `_` wildcard matches exactly one character. In PostgreSQL, `LIKE` is case sensitive, while `ILIKE` is not. In SQLite, `LIKE` is case insensitive and the latter keyword does not exist.\n",
    "\n",
    "PostgreSQL also has support for \"full text\" or natural language matching, which allows for variations in capitalization, spelling, and evens word forms (singular and plural, etc). This is implemented through two distinct data types: `tsvector`s to represent documents and `tsquery`s to represent the patterns to be matched. Strings must be converted to these with either `to_tsvector('text')` and `to_tsquery('pattern')` or casting. The expression `document @@ pattern` tests whether a `tsvector` contains a `tsquery`.\n",
    "\n",
    "A query string is composed of words linked by operators:\n",
    "- `&` indicates both elements should appear somewhere in the document, not necessarily together\n",
    "- `|` indicates that at least one element should match\n",
    "- `!` indicates that the following element should **not** match\n",
    "- `<->` indicates that the two elements should appear adjacent and in that order. This is equivalent to `<1>`; larger values of the number indicate larger gaps between the words.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that for the first three, doubled version of the operator can be used to link two `tsquery`s, while `<->` can also be used as an operator on its own.\n",
    "\n",

So, to get the last of the month, make a series of first days and subtract 1.\n",

    "```\n",
    "As with `ORDER BY` in general, this gives ascending order; use `DESC` to rank from largest to smallest.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Ranking\n",
    "\n",
    "The `RANK` function is similar to `ROW_NUMBER` except that rows with equivelent values are given the same rank, with the rank incremented accordingly for the next distinct value.\n",
    "```sql\n",
    "RANK() OVER (ORDER BY col) AS col_rank\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "The function `DENSE_RANK()` has the same behavior for ties, but does not increment. In other words, in descending order, a dense rank of $n$ represents \"the $n^\\text{th}$ highest distinct value.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Comparing values across rows\n",
    "\n",
    "The `LAG(col, n)` function returns the value in a column `col`, offset by `n` rows upwards (i.e. \"previously\"). This can be used to capture changing values:\n",
